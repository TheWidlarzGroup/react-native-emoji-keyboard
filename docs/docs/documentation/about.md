RN Emoji Keyboard aims to provide Emoji picker feature that is missing in native keyboards.

## Motivation

At the beginning we wanted to allow user to select any emoji for post reactions in our example app [Holidaily] but unfortunately, there isn't native feature to call out keyboard with option to select only emoji (or even default switched to emoji) neither any library with this feature (or more precisely - any good enough for us). Thus, the motivation for building this library was to allow user picking any emoji without allowing to type anything from keyboard. If you want to build features like emoji selector in chat app or Messenger like emoji reaction, this library is perfect for you

## Library Overview
